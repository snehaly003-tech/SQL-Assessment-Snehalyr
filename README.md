# SQL-Assessment-Snehalyr

SQL Final Project Submission :
Name : Snehal Yerkuntwar (snehalyr) 
NOTE : In OneCompiler , The Data Creation and Data Entry Part are common for all sub-tasks. 
The SQL codes and their explanation for all the (Questions and its Answer) tasks are in the same file. 
You need to scroll down to arrive at every question and its SQL query along with its explanation. The main query or code is Inactivated by “- -”. 
So whenever you have to check the query, just remove “- -” before ‘SELECT /INSERT’ command and verify it on Output prompt, and then reapply “- -”  so that it does not overlap on other queries. 
You will find comment “ Task Begins from Here”  and from there apply as mentioned above
OR You may just copy and paste the task wise code in the onecompiler excluding to get the same output as submitted
